**The self-improving AI agent built by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com).** It's the only agent with a built-in learning loop — it creates skills from experience, improves them during use, nudges itself to persist knowledge, searches its own past conversations, and builds a deepening model of who you are across sessions. Run it on a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, or serverless infrastructure that costs nearly nothing when idle. It's not tied to your laptop — talk to it from Telegram while it works on a cloud VM.

Use any model you want — [Nous Portal](https://portal.nousresearch.com), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (200+ models), [z.ai/GLM](https://z.ai), [Kimi/Moonshot](https://platform.moonshot.ai), [MiniMax](https://www.minimax.io), OpenAI, or your own endpoint. Switch with `hermes model` — no code changes, no lock-in.

## Migrating from OpenClaw

If you're coming from OpenClaw, Hermes can automatically import your settings, memories, skills, and API keys.

**During first-time setup:** The setup wizard (`hermes setup`) automatically detects `~/.openclaw` and offers to migrate before configuration begins.

**Anytime after install:**

```bash
hermes claw migrate              # Interactive migration (full preset)
hermes claw migrate --dry-run    # Preview what would be migrated
hermes claw migrate --preset user-data   # Migrate without secrets
hermes claw migrate --overwrite  # Overwrite existing conflicts
```

What gets imported:
- **SOUL.md** — persona file
- **Memories** — MEMORY.md and USER.md entries
- **Skills** — user-created skills → `~/.hermes/skills/openclaw-imports/`
- **Command allowlist** — approval patterns
- **Messaging settings** — platform configs, allowed users, working directory
- **API keys** — allowlisted secrets (Telegram, OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs)
- **TTS assets** — workspace audio files
- **Workspace instructions** — AGENTS.md (with `--workspace-target`)

See `hermes claw migrate --help` for all options, or use the `openclaw-migration` skill for an interactive agent-guided migration with dry-run previews.

## Messaging Gateway

Chat with Hermes from Telegram, Discord, Slack, or WhatsApp. The gateway is a single background process that connects to all your configured platforms, handles sessions, runs cron jobs, and delivers voice messages.

### Setting Up Messaging Platforms

The easiest way to configure messaging platforms is the interactive setup wizard:

```bash
hermes gateway setup        # Interactive setup for all messaging platforms
```

This walks you through configuring each platform with arrow-key selection, shows which platforms are already configured, and offers to start/restart the gateway service when you're done.

You can also configure platforms manually by editing `~/.hermes/.env` directly (see platform-specific details below).

### Gateway Commands

```bash
hermes gateway              # Run in foreground
hermes gateway setup        # Configure messaging platforms interactively
hermes gateway install      # Install as systemd service (Linux) / launchd (macOS)
hermes gateway start        # Start the service
hermes gateway stop         # Stop the service
hermes gateway status       # Check service status
```

 feat/oss-forensics-skill
The installer will offer to set this up automatically if it detects a bot token.

### Running Multiple Instances

If you need to run separate environments (e.g., dev/prod or a work/personal gateway), use the `HERMES_HOME` environment variable to override where Hermes looks for `~/.hermes`:

```bash
# Gateway 1 runs with standard config
hermes gateway

# Gateway 2 runs with a completely separate config, tokens, and DBs
HERMES_HOME=~/.hermes-dev hermes gateway
```


=======
 main
### Telegram Setup

1. **Create a bot:** Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram, use `/newbot`
2. **Get your user ID:** Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) — it replies with your numeric ID
3. **Configure:** Run `hermes gateway setup` and select Telegram, or add to `~/.hermes/.env` manually:

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC-DEF...
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=YOUR_USER_ID    # Comma-separated for multiple users
```

4. **Start the gateway:** `hermes gateway`

### Discord Setup

1. **Create a bot:** Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. **Enable intents:** Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents → enable Message Content Intent
3. **Get your user ID:** Enable Developer Mode in Discord settings, right-click your name → Copy ID
4. **Invite to your server:** OAuth2 → URL Generator → scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands` → permissions: Send Messages, Read Message History, Attach Files
5. **Configure:** Run `hermes gateway setup` and select Discord, or add to `~/.hermes/.env` manually:

```bash
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=MTIz...
DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS=YOUR_USER_ID
```

### Slack Setup

1. **Create an app:** Go to [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps), create a new app
2. **Enable Socket Mode:** In app settings → Socket Mode → Enable
3. **Get tokens:**
   - Bot Token (`xoxb-...`): OAuth & Permissions → Install to Workspace
   - App Token (`xapp-...`): Basic Information → App-Level Tokens → Generate
4. **Configure:** Run `hermes gateway setup` and select Slack, or add to `~/.hermes/.env` manually:

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-...
SLACK_ALLOWED_USERS=U01234ABCDE    # Comma-separated Slack user IDs
```

### WhatsApp Setup

WhatsApp doesn't have a simple bot API like Telegram or Discord. Hermes includes a built-in bridge using [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) that connects via WhatsApp Web.

**Two modes are supported:**

| Mode | How it works | Best for |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Separate bot number** (recommended) | Dedicate a phone number to the bot. People message that number directly. | Clean UX, multiple users |
| **Personal self-chat** | Use your own WhatsApp. You message yourself to talk to the agent. | Quick setup, single user |

**Setup:**

```bash
hermes whatsapp
```

The wizard will:
1. Ask which mode you want
2. For **bot mode**: guide you through getting a second number (WhatsApp Business app on a dual-SIM, Google Voice, or cheap prepaid SIM)
3. Configure the allowlist
4. Install bridge dependencies (Node.js required)
5. Display a QR code — scan from WhatsApp (or WhatsApp Business) → Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device
6. Exit once paired

**Start the gateway:**

```bash
hermes gateway            # Foreground
hermes gateway install    # Or install as a system service (Linux)
```

The gateway starts the WhatsApp bridge automatically using the saved session.

> **Note:** WhatsApp Web sessions can disconnect if WhatsApp updates their protocol. The gateway reconnects automatically. If you see persistent failures, re-pair with `hermes whatsapp`. Agent responses are prefixed with "⚕ Hermes Agent" for easy identification.

See [docs/messaging.md](docs/messaging.md) for advanced WhatsApp configuration.

### Gateway Commands (inside chat)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/new` or `/reset` | Start fresh conversation |
| `/model [name]` | Show or change the model |
| `/personality [name]` | Set a personality |
| `/retry` | Retry the last message |
| `/undo` | Remove the last exchange |
| `/status` | Show session info |
| `/stop` | Stop the running agent |
| `/sethome` | Set this chat as the home channel |
| `/compress` | Manually compress conversation context |
| `/usage` | Show token usage for this session |
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/<skill-name>` | Invoke any installed skill (e.g., `/axolotl`, `/gif-search`) |

### DM Pairing (Alternative to Allowlists)

Instead of manually configuring user IDs in allowlists, you can use the pairing system. When an unknown user DMs your bot, they receive a one-time pairing code:

```bash
# The user sees: "Pairing code: XKGH5N7P"
# You approve them with:
hermes pairing approve telegram XKGH5N7P

# Other pairing commands:
hermes pairing list          # View pending + approved users
hermes pairing revoke telegram 123456789  # Remove access
```

Pairing codes expire after 1 hour, are rate-limited, and use cryptographic randomness.

### Security

**By default, the gateway denies all users who are not in an allowlist or paired via DM.** This is the safe default for a bot with terminal access.

```bash
# Restrict to specific users (recommended):
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789,987654321
DISCORD_ALLOWED_USERS=123456789012345678

# Or explicitly allow all users (NOT recommended for bots with terminal access):
GATEWAY_ALLOW_ALL_USERS=true
```
